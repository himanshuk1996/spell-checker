# spell-checker
This is a data structure approach for spelling corection and prediction. A trie node data structure has been used for 
saving all the vocabulary. Currently, this model is trained for nltk corpus of words. But, this model can also be trained 
for your own vocabulary, if you are not interested in all the words of nltk corpus, and only interested in your own specific 
vocabulary.

This approach is different from conventional ML approach, because it does not compare the word(needed to be corrected) with every 
word in vocabulary. It only travels in one unique direction, according to the words present in it. The whole methodology is very 
vast, which I will give sometimes in future.
